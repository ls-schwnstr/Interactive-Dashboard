# Project: Interactive Dashboard exploring global fertility rates 
## Introduction
This Dashboard displays fertility rates for different age groups in various countries over the past fifty years. It includes a choropleth map and several bar charts, which are interactive and responsive to each other. Users can click on a country on the map to see the corresponding charts for the selected country. Overall, the dashboard provides an intuitive and interactive way to explore and compare fertility rate trends across countries and age groups.
